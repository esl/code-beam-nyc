Typically an Elixir project starts with a manifest and references Erlang libraries as dependencies.  What if the starting point is an Erlang code base, and you want to take advantage of the mix tool to build and expose all eunit, eproper, cover, ct, exref targets?  This talk will focus on illustrating how it can be done.

**TALK OBJECTIVES:**

Achieve an understanding that it's possible to use Elixir toolchain even for Erlang projects without limits.

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**

Erlang/Elixir developers.
