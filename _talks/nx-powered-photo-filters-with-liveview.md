We'll start by discussing the basics of what image filtering is and how images are represented in computers. Next, we'll write a few simple image filters from scratch using Nx, analyzing how that code can then be deployed via Nx.Serving.
With the filters ready, we'll discuss some strategies on how to deliver them to clients with LiveView.

By the end of this presentation, we'll have a simple application that can capture images from the user's webcam and switch between the various filters we've implemented.

**TALK OBJECTIVE:**
- The main goal is to show how Nx can be used in regular LiveView applications, while also introducing the basics of deployment for Nx code. As a secondary goal, the audience will also learn a bit more about image processing.
**TARGET AUDIENCE:**
- People who are generally acquainted with LiveView and want to learn about Nx, although deep LiveView knowledge is not necessary. No previous knowledge about Nx is needed.
- Beginners and experts in both numerical computing and web apps can enjoy different aspects of the talk.
